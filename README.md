# expense-tracker

Built with Next.js and TypeScript, this is a web application made to help people manage their money. I built this because it seemed like a useful project, but I also built it to learn full-stack web development, Next.js, and TypeScript.

## Features

- [x] Create, read, edit, and delete expenses.
- [ ] Filter expenses by custom tags.
- [ ] Sorting expenses by date, name, and cost.
- [ ] Visualize spending by tag over a period of time.
- [ ] Export/print expense data as CSV or PDF.
